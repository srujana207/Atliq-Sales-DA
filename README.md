# Atliq-Sales-DA


üìÅ Atliq Sales Data Analysis

### Project Overview
This project focused on analyzing historical sales data for Atliq Hardware, covering the years 2017 through 2021. The goal was to assess sales performance across different regions, product segments, and customer groups, and to build interactive dashboards that support strategic decision-making. The project replicates a real-world business analyst scenario where data is messy, multi-sourced, and requires both SQL and dashboarding expertise.

#### Tools & Technologies Used

-MySQL (Joins, Aggregations, CASE statements)

-Power BI (DAX, Slicers, Drill-Down Reports, KPI Cards)

### Data Understanding and Preparation
