# Atliq-Sales-DA


📁 Atliq Sales Data Analysis

### Project Overview
This project focused on analyzing historical sales data for Atliq Hardware, covering the years 2017 through 2021. The goal was to assess sales performance across different regions, product segments, and customer groups, and to build interactive dashboards that support strategic decision-making. The project replicates a real-world business analyst scenario where data is messy, multi-sourced, and requires both SQL and dashboarding expertise.

#### Tools & Technologies Used

-MySQL (Joins, Aggregations, CASE statements)

-Power BI (DAX, Slicers, Drill-Down Reports, KPI Cards)

### Data Understanding and Preparation
Multiple datasets were imported, including sales transactions, customer data, product hierarchies, and calendar mappings. SQL was used to join tables, clean up nulls and duplicates, standardize formats, and prepare aggregated views. These views were then imported into Power BI for visualization.

#### 🔍 Key Takeaways

##### 🌍 Regional Sales Trends
- **Delhi NCR** generated over ₹519M in revenue — more than half of total sales.

### 📈 Dashboard Insights

- **Financial status**: Despite decent revenue volume, trends indicate a **gradual decline in revenue** from mid-2018 to 2020.
- **Top-performing regions**: Northern and western markets (Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Ahmedabad) dominate sales.
- **Product distribution**: Revenue is not overly concentrated in one SKU, reducing product risk.
- **Customer concentration risk**: One customer contributes a large portion of revenue — a potential vulnerability.
- **Growth concern**: Revenue peaked at ₹43M in mid-2018 but has shown a **downward trend** since.
