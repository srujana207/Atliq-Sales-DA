# Atliq-Sales-DA


üìÅ Atliq Sales Data Analysis

### Project Overview
This project focused on analyzing historical sales data for Atliq Hardware, covering the years 2017 through 2021. The goal was to assess sales performance across different regions, product segments, and customer groups, and to build interactive dashboards that support strategic decision-making. The project replicates a real-world business analyst scenario where data is messy, multi-sourced, and requires both SQL and dashboarding expertise.

#### Tools & Technologies Used

-MySQL (Joins, Aggregations, CASE statements)

-Power BI (DAX, Slicers, Drill-Down Reports, KPI Cards)

### Data Understanding and Preparation
Multiple datasets were imported, including sales transactions, customer data, product hierarchies, and calendar mappings. SQL was used to join tables, clean up nulls and duplicates, standardize formats, and prepare aggregated views. These views were then imported into Power BI for visualization.

#### Key Analysis

-Regional Sales Trends: North America led total revenue, but Asia-Pacific showed the highest YoY growth.

-Product Segments: Enterprise-grade products contributed to 65% of total sales, while the entry-level line underperformed.

-Top Customers: A few key accounts drove a large portion of sales; churn risk was flagged for inactive customers.

-Channel Analysis: Direct sales performed better than resellers, especially in developed markets.

### Dashboard Insights
The Power BI dashboard featured filters by year, region, product, and customer. KPI indicators tracked revenue, profit margin, and sales volume. Users could drill down from global trends to individual customer performance.

### Impact & Conclusion
The insights generated from the Atliq sales data could help the business refine regional strategies, optimize product offerings, and focus on high-value customer retention.
